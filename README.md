Overview

WellMind is a web-based mental health companion built using React.js (frontend) and Node.js/Spring Boot (backend). It offers users a safe space to track their moods, access tailored recommendations, and stay informed with mental health resources.
Features

    âœ… Mood tracking with daily logs

    âœ… Personalized health recommendations

    âœ… Mental health resources and articles

    âœ… Secure user authentication

    âœ… Responsive design for desktop and mobile

Architecture

Frontend:
- React.js (JavaScript)
  - Component-based design
  - State management with Context API/Redux (if applicable)
  - REST API integration

Backend:
- Spring Boot (Java)
  - RESTful API services
  - MongoDB (Document Store)
  - JWT-based authentication (optional)

Database:
- MongoDB
  - Stores user data, mood logs, recommendations, resources

Deployment:
- Vercel/Netlify (Frontend)
- Heroku/AWS EC2 (Backend)

Key Points:

    Frontend handles user interactions, forms, and displaying mental health resources.

    Backend provides authentication, data persistence, and business logic.

    Database stores mood logs, user information, and recommendations.

Trade-offs and Design Decisions

    Technology Choices:

        React.js chosen for rapid UI development and component reusability.

        Spring Boot selected for its robustness and ease of building REST APIs.

        MongoDB selected due to its flexibility in handling unstructured mood logs and recommendations.

    Scalability vs. Simplicity:

        Initial focus on simplicity; may transition to microservices if scaling becomes necessary.

    Authentication:

        JWT tokens considered for stateless authentication, balancing security and ease of use.

    Testing:

        Chose to start with manual testing and Postman to validate API endpoints before adding automated tests.

Testing

    Unit Tests (planned): JUnit for backend services.

    Integration Tests (planned): Postman for API testing.

    Manual Testing: Verified key workflows (e.g., login, mood logging, fetching recommendations).

    Future Plans:

        Cypress/Jest for frontend testing.

        Continuous Integration pipeline for automated testing.
